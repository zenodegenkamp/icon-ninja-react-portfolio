# Icon Ninja 

I conceptualized and developed this project as an integral facet of the "Essential JavaScript concepts‚Äù module, a pivotal component of the Front-End Developer career path offered by Scrimba.  I later rebuild it into a REACT app. This REACT-based project has been meticulously crafted to provide users with an immersive and visually stunning experience, featuring elements like parallax scrolling and interactive 3D objects sourced from Spline. Upon entering the ICON NINJA world, users are seamlessly transported into a futuristic realm. This transition is elegantly achieved through the art of parallax scrolling, guiding users as they journey deeper into the immersive gaming environment. As users scroll, they find themselves within the captivating confines of the gaming room, where the real challenge begins. The primary objective of ICON NINJA is to skilfully match all the icons while minimizing the number of rolls required to achieve this feat. It's a test of strategy, skill, and precision that keeps users engaged and entertained. To further enrich the experience, the app leverages Firebase, a robust platform, to securely store and manage high scores, fostering friendly competition and encouraging players to continually strive for excellence. ICON NINJA is more than just a game; it's a captivating fusion of cutting-edge technology and interactive design, providing users with an unforgettable journey into the world of digital entertainment.
